- 👋 Hello World!, I’m Matthew B, vocalist/guitarist/producer for @TheSubtleMadness.
- 👀 I am a Recording Engineer, Musician, & Student, interested in coding, web, and graphic design, as well as studio engineering/production.  
- 🌱 Back to the grind for Spring 2023 Semester and working at the studio.  Skills that I am currently learning are C++, Git, GitHub, HTML5, CSS, Java, and Graphic Design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on music and/or coding as time and opportunites allow.  My current focus is on learning c++, as well as digital imaging (Photoshop), after finishing the build and deployment of my first modern, responsive, and professional web site.
