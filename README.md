- 👋 Hello World!, I’m Matthew B, vocalist/guitarist/producer for @TheSubtleMadness.
- 👀 I am a Recording Engineer, Musician, & Student, interested in coding, web, and graphic design, as well as studio engineering/production.  
- 🌱 Both my Fall 2022 Semester & my internship-to-hire grind at the studio are finished!!  Skills that I am currently learning are Git, GitHub, HTML5, CSS, Java, and Graphic Design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on music and/or coding as time and opportunites allow.  My current focus is on finishing the build and deployment of my 	first modern, responsive, and professional web site for my IMED-1316 class and our band, The Subtle Madness, as we prepare to release our new album, Zero Sum.
