- 👋 Hello World! from @TheSubtleMadness.  My name is Matt B
- 👀 I am a Web Developer, Graphic Designer, and CS Student, interested in full-stack web site/app development, programming, and UI/UX.  I am also a musician and recording engineer.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of web apps and other projects as time and opportunites allow.  My current focus is on learning C++, Python, Django, and React.  I am continuing to build a portfolio of professional, modern, and responsive web apps that I've built.
- More to come soon!...
